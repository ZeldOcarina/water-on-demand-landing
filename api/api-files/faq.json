No major construction, no headaches, and they can be taken out as easily as they were put in. Those machines exist, and we have them.. It’s called Water Systems In A Box™r, and it’s the perfect technology for the new, fully-financed water systems for business.</p><h5>Step Two: Total Outsourcing</h5><p>We sign up the customer for a multi-year managed services contract. All they have to do is pay by the gallon, we take care of the rest. No capital expense, they just pay one monthly bill. We take care of the maintenance–everything. That’s total outsourcing.</p><p>“Pay by the month” is profitable. Have you noticed that you’re paying more by the month for Microsoft Office? But, have you noticed that it’s a better product? Managed services are sweeping the world of business, and for good reason: everybody wins.</p><p>Now it’s water’s turn. Our models show it’s both profitable and creates contractually assured revenue. Once a business commits to Water On Demand, it won’t want to stop. Here’s a snapshot from our 25-year model. With just a $20 million investment in water systems, we generate $40 million for the investors alone!</p>"
