        "question": "How do I convert to common stock?",
        "answer": "<p>For the publicly traded stock in the parent company, you can convert at any time. One reason to do it might be to capture the current relatively low price. This is effectively a measure of downside protection and you are protected on the upside by a ceiling of $0.25, which is subjecty to change for later investors. Please note that once converted, you have no price protection. The portion of your Founder’s Shares in WODI are intended to be convertible into common stock once WODI achieves a public listing. Until that time, the market for these private shares is limited***</p>"

This guarantees your price on potentially investing twice more.</p><p>o You have the option to buy (or exercise) the warrant “cashless”. Cashless means you can offset the cost of the warrant with warrant shares, so you don’t have to pay any cash. You can still pay cash, to maximize the amount of shares you get.</p>"

    {
        "question": "What do you plan to use the funds for?",
        "answer": "<p>Of the $300 million raised we plan to invest <span class=\"underlined\">at least</span> $250 million in a Water On Demand™ or WOD subsidiary, for the sole purpose of investing in water projects. The equipment will be owned by the WOD subsidiary and is intended for water managed services (pay-per-gallon).</p><p>When the funds are idle, we may make secured loans to generate income while the funds are idle. We have already completed an initial secured loan and distributed dividends.</p><p> o We plan to allocate the remaining $50 million to build our ability to manage water services. The discretionary allocations do not affect your percentage of net profits which remains 25% on your entire investment.</p>"

    {
        "question": "How will you develop the ability to deliver managed services?",
        "answer": "<p>We intend to use our funds to develop project management and quality control capabilities, and also to contract with outside water companies for the actual building and onsite maintenance of these systems.</p>"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is my profit share from WOD?",
        "answer": "<p>You are to receive a percentage of Net Profits, proportional to your investment, for the life of the WOD projects in which your investment resides, which is set initially at 20 years. In the event the money is reinvested in a new project, you will continue to receive the royalty. If the WOD subsidiary (capital corporation) you are invested in is wound up, you will receive a pro rata distribution of the net profits from the windup.</p><p>Is there an opportunity to earn even more than 25% net profits on my investment?</p><p>Yes, we believe these capital equipment assets can be leveraged through traditional banking. While financial leverage can be as high as 10 to 1, our more modest estimates, subject to experience, are 3 to 1. By way of example: if $100,000 in capital equipment were to generate $100,000 in royalties over 20 years, the $300,000 that it may be leveraged to could pay $300,000. In this example the investor would receive $300,000 in royalties as a result of their capital facilitating such leverage. So, even though this example only invested $100,000 they would receive the same 25% royalties on the fully leveraged asset of $300,000. How much leverage will be achieved will be confirmed over time. <span class=\"italic\">It is possible that no such leverage would occur.</span></p>"
    },
    {
        "question": "What can you charge the WOD subsidiary for your work?",
        "answer": "<p>We may charge ordinary and reasonable management, operating, service, maintenance and parts and consumables fees.</p>"
    },
    {
        "question": "How are Net Profits defined?",
        "answer": "<p>Net Profits are calculated according to normal GAAP standards. after all costs and expenses are deducted, including allocations of intercompany expenses and any interest expenses, but before the deduction of income taxes. Any past losses (of WOD subsidiary) will be accounted for prior to calculation of Net Profits.</p><p>If I sell my shares in either the parent company or Water On Demand™ in some near term liquidity event, would I still receive my profit shares from my initial investment?</p><p>For your water asset investment, your profit share is permanent, whether you sell the stock or not.</p>"
    },
    {
        "question": "Who else gets a percentage of Net Profits and am I impacted?",
        "answer": "<p>We may compensate strategic partners or finders from Net Profits.</p><p>They are always paid, or repaid, from our profit share. Your share is not affected.</p>"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is my security in this investment?",
        "answer": "<p>In the event we redeem or liquidate the WOD subsidiary, you will be entitled to receive your original investment, and any unpaid Net Profits due to you.</p><p>The payment of your right to receive a percentage of Net Profits  is guaranteed by a security agreement that gives you the right to file a lien against Water On Demand to enforce this right.</p>"
