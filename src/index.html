          Did you know that you can invest directly in oil production and
          pipelines? It’s called a Master Limited Partnership (MLP). Invented in
          1981 by Apache Corporation, it’s a great way to build generational
          wealth from oil exploration and production. We’ve based Water On
          Demand™ on those MLPs – with a better incentive structure. How?

          Water On Demand projects, while also getting a long-term stock
